                <p>
                    <b>Bhagat Singh's Life
                        Bhagat Singh was born in a Sikh family in Banga village of Faisalabad district (previously
                        called Lyallpur), now in Pakistan's Punjab province, on 27 September 1907. As his family was
                        deeply inspired by nationalism, he too became actively involved in the country's freedom
                        movements. <br> <br>

                        He quit education at the age of thirteen and got admitted to the National College in Lahore,
                        where he studied European revolutionary movements. When his parents tried to get him married,
                        Bhagat Singh left home for Kanpur. In 1926, Bhagat Singh established the 'Naujavan Bharat Sabha
                        (Youth Society of India) and joined the Hindustan Republican Association (later known as
                        Hindustan Socialist Republican Association). During that time, he met many anti-colonial
                        activists. <br> <br>

                        In December 1928, Bhagat Singh, along with Sukhdev and Rajguru, planned to avenge the death of
                        Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai and plotted to assassinate the Superintendent of
                        Police James Scott in Lahore. <br><br>

                        However, in a case of mistaken identity, John Saunders, the Assistant Superintendent of Police
                        was shot. To avoid being recognised and arrested for the crime, Bhagat Singh escaped from Lahore
                        to Calcutta after shaving his beard and cutting his hair. <br><br>

                        In April 1929, Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt bombed the Central Assembly Hall in Delhi, and shouted
                        the slogan of “Inquilab Zindabad!”. He was later arrested after the incident.

                   <br> <h3><u>Execution of Bhagat Singh</u></h3><br>
                        <p> Singh and his revolutionary comrades Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged by the British on
                        March 23, 1931, in the Lahore Conspiracy case.

                <h3>Here's a time line of Shaheed Bhagat Singh's life:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        1923- Joined the National College in Lahore.
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1928- British set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Lala
                        Lajpat Rai, a prominent leader of HRA, Rai died of a heart attack.
                        Enraged by his incident, Singh vowed to avenge Rai’s death and teamed up with other
                        revolutionaries, Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar and Chandrashekhar Azad to make a plan to kill
                        Scott.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1929- Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its
                        public gallery. Their intention was not to kill anyone but to gain publicity. After the
                        explosion, the young men began shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long Live the
                        Revolution") and threw leaflets. Then they offered themselves for arrest.
                    </li>

                        1931 - Singh’s growing popularity bothered the British authorities greatly and the government
                        decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial, which was henceforth called the
                        Lahore Conspiracy Case.
                        Hanged in the Lahore jail. Bhagat Singh was just 23 years old. The bodies were then secretly
                        cremated outside Ganda Singh Wala village.
